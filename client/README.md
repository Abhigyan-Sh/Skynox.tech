## An issue !
> You might have to hit command `npm run dev` again when navigating through page or when refreshed. I am still looking for a solution on why do I have to hit commnand again and will update this github repo once I find it.

Everything is working just as was expected.

I have also done the bonus challenge !

## Things I got to learn !

> Thanks for letting me to work on this challenge as with completion of this challenge now I know how to make 
- transition between pages in Next.js
- how to handle backend server side requests in Next.js
- using `useRouter()`
- `Dynamic Routes`
- Data Fetching using `getServerSideProps` but also I got to read about `getStaticPaths`, 
 `getStaticProps`, `ISR`.
- `ctx.query.SinglePost` took long enough time to get to it after going through various docs and posts.


### Looking forward to hear about further steps !
