## Things I got to learn !

> Thanks for letting me to work on this challenge as with completion of this challenge now I know how to make 
- transition between pages in Next.js
- how to handle backend server side requests in Next.js
- using `useRouter()`
- `Dynamic Routes`
- Data Fetching using `getServerSideProps` but also I got to read about `getStaticPaths`, 
 `getStaticProps`, `ISR`.
- `ctx.query.SinglePost` took long enough time to get to it after going through various docs and posts.
